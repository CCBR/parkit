# Release Notes: v3.0.0

## Highlights

- Introduced Python-native `projark` command in package.
- Added `projark deposit` and `projark retrieve` subcommands.
- Added sync preflight gate (`parkit checkapisync`) before operations.
- Added Helix and session preflight checks (`tmux`, `screen`, or Open OnDemand graphical session).
- Clarification: Open OnDemand is currently available only on Biowulf compute nodes, not directly on Helix. Since `projark` is Helix-only today, use `tmux`/`screen` on Helix; Open OnDemand support is future-facing until Helix access is available.
- Added configurable deposit split threshold (`--split-size-gb`, default `500`).
- Added full-collection retrieval mode when `--filenames` is omitted.
- Added split-part merge support (`--unsplit`) across multiple tar groups.
- Archived legacy bash `projark` script.
- Added short options for `projark` inputs (for example `-f`, `-p`, `-d`, `-n`, `-u`).
- Added `projectnumber` normalization that strips repeated leading `ccbr` prefixes and accepts any non-empty remainder.
- Added absolute-path normalization for `--folder` inputs.
- Added ISO 8601 timestamps in `projark` logs.
- Added completion/failure email notifications to `$USER@nih.gov` from `NCICCBR@mail.nih.gov`.

## Behavior Notes

- `projark --version`, `projark deposit --version`, and `projark retrieve --version` now provide the same package-aware version output.
- Version-only invocations avoid unrelated bootstrap warnings.

## Migration Notes

Users previously relying on bash `projark` should switch to:

- `projark deposit ...`
- `projark retrieve ...`
