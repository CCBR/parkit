# Release Notes: v3.0.0

## Highlights

- Introduced Python-native `projark` command in package.
- Added `projark deposit` and `projark retrieve` subcommands.
- Added sync preflight gate (`parkit checkapisync`) before operations.
- Added Helix and `tmux`/`screen` preflight checks.
- Added configurable deposit split threshold (`--split-size-gb`, default `500`).
- Added full-collection retrieval mode when `--filenames` is omitted.
- Added split-part merge support (`--unsplit`) across multiple tar groups.
- Archived legacy bash `projark` script.

## Behavior Notes

- `projark --version`, `projark deposit --version`, and `projark retrieve --version` now provide the same package-aware version output.
- Version-only invocations avoid unrelated bootstrap warnings.

## Migration Notes

Users previously relying on bash `projark` should switch to:

- `projark deposit ...`
- `projark retrieve ...`
